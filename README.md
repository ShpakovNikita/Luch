# Luch

Luch means ray in Russian

Luch is my ongoing 3D graphics engine playground project.

Right now only has deferred pipeline.

Supports loading glTF 2.0 static scenes (no keyframe animations, skeletal animations and morphing).

Supports punctual lights: directional, point and spot.

Work in Progress:
* Render graph
* Shadow mapping

Planned (in no particular order):
* iOS Support
* Vulkan middleware
* Area lights
* Keyframe Animations
* Skeletal Animations
* Shader reloading
* Light probes
